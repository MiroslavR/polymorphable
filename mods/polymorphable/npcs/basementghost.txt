him=These ruins have been here a long time, before the founding of Laurelia.
him=During the dark times when we the Kingdom was ruled by King Hestian, we fled here, and built a city in the light.
him=Some people, including the sorcerer Zalkaz, created warrens under the city, in case the mad King's soldiers found us.
him=Zalkaz conducted experiments in the darkness while the other Laurelians remained in the light.
him=After the mad King died, he sent guards to root our Zalkaz, with the assistance of the Laurelian populace.
him=The skeletons you see down here are the remainder of his frightening experiments.
him=Take this talisman, which has a piece of your shadow bound to it.  You should now be able to remain humanoid while incorporeal.
