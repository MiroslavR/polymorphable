him=Hello, Daphne.
her=How do you know my name?  Why aren't you attacking me?
him=I knew your father long ago...  it was here he first battled Zalkaz, to try and seal him away.  Half the Juggernaut Talisman is in here.
him=There is now a lava ward preventing anyone from passing to the house...
him=I can get across, but alas, I am already dead.  Stay away from the lava unless you want to be dead, too.
her=I think I learned not to touch hot objects when I was three, thanks for the tip.
