him=Good morning Daphne.
you=Good morning Wot!  Clara working you hard?

you=Keep at it!  One of these days, maybe you'll be as good a smith as she is!
him=I hope so, but I suppose I can always join the King's knights if this doesn't pan out.
you=Oh, don't be silly - you couldn't leave this village.  I've seen how Waka looks at you!
him=Wait, what?  She's never said anything!
you=Oh, I see her staring.
him=*Wot blushes*
you=See you around!
