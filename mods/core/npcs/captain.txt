him=Good afternoon.
you=Slow day?
him=Very slow...  that new recruit keeps getting hit by the combat dummy, though, so that's good for a laugh.

him=Daphne, did you feel that earthquake?
you=I...  may have caused it.  Inadvertently.
him=By the gods, girl!  It wrecked my entire jail, it's a mess down there now!
you=Was anyone hurt?  It's not like there's any prisoners down there.
him=No, but there's a huge gap in the wall now.  I hear rushing water, and I'm worried this entire place is going to collapse into a sinkhole.  If only there were some way to investigate.
you=You can't make it over?
him=No, there's a pit I can't even see the bottom of!
you=I guess I could take a look.
