him=We're getting away for a few days.  Castle life is just so hectic!
him=Don't tell Harry, but I'm really interested in going to the volcano - there might even be some obsidian there!
him=Only trouble is, it's too hot to get close enough.  If only there was a way to traverse the lava.

him=We're almost ready to go back home to the castle, but I still haven't been to the volcano.
you=I'd let you borrow this charm, but apparently they only work for Laurelians,
him=Shucks.  Well, if you ever want to visit us back at the castle, just let me know!
