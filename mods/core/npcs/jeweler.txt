you=Hey, is this worth anything?
her=Oh, it's beautiful!  It's not worth a lot right now, but I can set it into a necklace.
you=That would be great, thanks!  How much do I owe you?
her=Oh, consider it a favor for helping save the village.
you=Could you maybe convince Clara to give me equipment for free while you're at it?
her=Oh, no, I could never ask that.  If you find yourself in Keradon, though, look me up, and tell your friends!
