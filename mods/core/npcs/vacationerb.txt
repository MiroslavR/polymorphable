him=Ah, the vacation life!
him=I hear there's some great spelunking to the north, and skiing to the south.
him=Do you know where I rent some skis around here?
you=Uh, I'm not sure we have any shops like that.
him=Darn.  Our castle is way more impressive than your ruined one here, I'll bet you could get skis there.
